## Project proposal 

### Synopsis
EthoDetector aims to integrate low-shot detection models (GeCo and CountGD) into a unified ethology detection tool with a napari-based GUI. The project involves developing API adapters for these models, creating an interactive napari widget for annotation, and optimizing model inference for performance. Deliverables include a working napari plugin, batch-processing support, and benchmarked performance metrics.

### **Implementation Timeline**

#### **Minimal Deliverables**
- Develop adapter classes for **GeCo** and **CountGD**, ensuring compatibility with their respective PyTorch implementations.
- Implement **unified input/output handling**, including:
  - Bounding box format conversion (COCO ↔ model-specific formats).
  - Prompt embedding extraction for text-based detection (for CountGD).
  - Multi-frame consistency checks to ensure detection stability across frames.
- Design and implement an **API** to handle model inference and store annotations in a structured format.
- Develop a **basic Napari widget** that enables:
  - Loading and displaying video frame sequences.
  - Manual annotation via bounding boxes.
- Implement a **model configuration panel** allowing users to select models, set parameters, and adjust **confidence sliders**.
- Enable **CSV/JSON import-export** functionality to allow saving and loading annotations efficiently.

#### **Stretch Goals**
- Add **interactive correction tools** (brush/eraser) for refining annotations directly in the UI.
- Implement **multi-scale inference support** to improve detection accuracy on different zoom levels.
- Integrate **CLIP-based text prompts** for CountGD to allow text-based detections.

#### **Weekly Timeline**

| Week | Deliverables |
|------|------------|
| 1-2  | Implement GeCo model adapter: load pretrained weights, preprocess input data, and return predictions in a standardized format. Set up a basic API structure for calling the model. |
| 3-4  | Develop CountGD model adapter: extract text prompt embeddings, support hybrid visual+text inputs, and unify its output format with GeCo. Implement bounding box conversion between COCO and model-specific formats. |
| 5-6  | Build the initial Napari widget with a frame sequence loader, thumbnail previews, and manual annotation support using bounding boxes. Allow saving/loading annotations in JSON format. |
| 7-8  | Implement model configuration panel, allowing users to select between models and adjust confidence thresholds. Add support for CSV export/import of annotations. |
| 9-10 | Optimize performance with caching (using zarr arrays for frame storage), batch processing, and multi-scale inference for improved detection accuracy. Conduct profiling using PyTorch's `torch.utils.bottleneck`. |
| 11   | Benchmark model performance on public ethology datasets (BeeTL, AntTrack) using metrics like mAP@0.5:0.95 and false positive rate. Fine-tune model parameters for optimal accuracy. |
| 12   | Finalize documentation, conduct end-to-end testing with synthetic and real datasets, fix bugs, and ensure plugin stability before submission. |


#### Work Commitment

- **Asynchronous Communication:** Zulip chat for discussions, GitHub for PR reviews
- **Documentation & Reports:** Weekly progress updates on GitHub Issues

## Personal statement

I am a third-year undergraduate at BITS Pilani, KK Birla Goa Campus, pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Electronics and Electrical Engineering. With a strong foundation in software engineering, I specialize in Python, machine learning, and building scalable systems.I am a software engineer with expertise in Python, machine learning, and scalable systems. Currently, I am working on a research paper titled "Cognitive Neuroscape: Gamified Frameworks for Multi-Dimensional Cognitive Assessment in Neurodegeneration". This project focuses on designing goal-based games to evaluate cognitive performance across age groups, leveraging machine learning to identify early biomarkers for neurodegenerative diseases.

This aligns closely with the cellfinder project, as both involve applying advanced computational methods to neuroscience challenges. My experience developing scalable AI solutions, such as a multilingual speech recognition app using AWS services and StickerForecast—a market forecasting model ranked in the global top 500 out of 10000 —has equipped me with the skills to implement and optimize new architectures for cellfinder. By contributing to this project, I aim to advance open-source tools that empower researchers in neuroscience.
### Past Experience
I have experience in Python, machine learning, and scalable systems, with prior work in deep learning-based detection models. Familiar with PyTorch, OpenCV, and napari, I have built ML-based tools for real-world applications, including annotation pipelines.

### Motivation
I'm passionate about computer vision and ethology. This project excites me because it bridges ML with behavioral analysis, enabling researchers to extract insights from animal studies efficiently.

### Match
With expertise in deep learning, experience in API design, and familiarity with napari, I am well-suited for this project. My past work on ML-driven object detection and optimization aligns with the project's goals.

### Availability
I have no conflicting commitments till Mid - August after that I may have a mandatory internship from mid-August at my college, but I will find 3 hours/day for GSOC work and get the rest of the work done over the weekend

## GSoC

### GSoC Experience
I expect to gain hands-on experience in open-source collaboration, learning best practices for scalable ML model deployment, and GUI integration.

### Other Applications
I am only trying to apply to this organisation.
